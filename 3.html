  <h2>Crooked Forest</h2>
  <img src="crooked.jpg" width="80%">
    <p>The Crooked Forest (Polish: Krzywy Las) is a grove of oddly-shaped pine trees located near the town of <u>Gryfino, West Pomerania, Poland.</u>
  </p>
    <p>This grove of about 100 pines was planted in the village of Nowe Czarnowo in around 1930. Each pine tree bends sharply to the north, just above ground level, then curves back upright after a sideways excursion of three to nine feet (1â€“3 m). The curved pines are enclosed by a surrounding forest of straight pine trees.
